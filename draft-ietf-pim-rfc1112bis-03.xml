<section anchor="summary"><name>Summary</name>

<t>This memo specifies the extensions required of a host implementation
of the Internet Protocol (IP) to support IP multicast. It replaces <xref target="RFC791"/>
for everything except for the specification of the protocol IGMP version 1
in Appendix I. of <xref target="RFC1112"/>. This document declares <xref target="RFC1112"/> including
IGMP version 1 historic.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC1112"/> specified IP multicast for version 4 of the IP protocol (IPv4, <xref target="RFC791"/>),
and refers to that version as IP. This document applies both to version 4 of the IP protocol
and version 6 of the IP protocol (IPv6, <xref target="RFC8200"/>). The term IP is used in this
document to refer to both versions. Where specifications in support of IP multicast
for version 6 of the IP protocol where already provided by other RFCs, this document
provides references to those pre-existing specifications, so that this document can
serve as a complete single point of reference for the host extensions for IP multicast
with either versions of IP.</t>

<t>"Source Specific Multicast", (SSM, <xref target="SSM"/>) introduced a complementary 
extension to the IP service from the one specified here.
It is relying on components specified here, such as {#ethernet}, and extending or
superseding others.  The service specified here is called
"Any Source Multicast" (ASM) to distinguish it explicitly from SSM.
This document also describes, where SSM changes specifications from <xref target="RFC1112"/>.</t>

<t>Due to the existence of both ASM and SSM, the term "IP multicast" best refers to the
complete set of IP host extensions in support of either service options:
this specification for ASM plus <xref target="SSM"/>).  When the term IP multicast is used to
refer to the IP multicast service without further qualification, then ASM is to be implied.</t>

<t>This specification aims to maintain all the original text of <xref target="RFC1112"/> where
technically appropriate. This incurs the use of some historic language, such as
"(internet) gateway" to refer to IP routers, and capitalization of chapter headings.</t>

<t>See <xref target="normative"/> and <xref target="changes"/> for a detailed list of changes from <xref target="RFC1112"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="overview"><name>Overview</name>

<t>IP multicasting is the transmission of an IP datagram to a "host
group", a set of zero or more hosts identified by a single IP
destination address.  A multicast datagram is delivered to all
members of its destination host group with the same "best-efforts"
reliability as regular unicast IP datagrams, i.e., the datagram is
not guaranteed to arrive intact at all members of the destination
group or in the same order relative to other datagrams.</t>

<t>The membership of a host group is dynamic; that is, hosts may join
and leave groups at any time.  There is no restriction on the
location or number of members in a host group.  A host may be a
member of more than one group at a time.  A host need not be a member
of a group to send datagrams to it.</t>

<t>A host group may be permanent or transient.  A permanent group has a
well-known, administratively assigned IP address.  It is the address,
not the membership of the group, that is permanent; at any time a
permanent group may have any number of members, even zero.  Those IP
multicast addresses that are not reserved for permanent groups are
available for dynamic assignment to transient groups which exist only
as long as they have members.</t>

<t>Internetwork forwarding of IP multicast datagrams is handled by
"multicast routers" which may be co-resident with, or separate from,
internet gateways.  A host transmits an IP multicast datagram as a
local network multicast which reaches all immediately-neighboring
members of the destination host group.  If the datagram has an IPv4
time-to-live or IPv6 hop limit greater than 1, the multicast router(s) attached to the
local network take responsibility for forwarding it towards all other
networks that have members of the destination group.  On those other
member networks that are reachable within the IPv4 time-to-live or IPv6 hop limit, an
attached multicast router completes delivery by transmitting the
datagram as a local multicast.</t>

<t>This memo specifies the extensions required of a host IP
implementation to support IP multicasting, where a "host" is any
internet host or gateway other than those acting as multicast
routers.  The algorithms and protocols used within and between
multicast routers are transparent to hosts and will be specified in
separate documents.  This memo also does not specify how local
network multicasting is accomplished for all types of network,
although it does specify the required service interface to an
arbitrary local network and gives an Ethernet specification as an
example.  Specifications for other types of network will be the
subject of future memos.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="levels-of-conformance"><name>LEVELS OF CONFORMANCE</name>

<t>There are three levels of conformance to this specification:</t>

<section anchor="level-0-no-support-for-ip-multicasting"><name>Level 0: no support for IP multicasting.</name>

<t>There is, at this time, no requirement that all IP implementations
support IP multicasting.  Level 0 hosts will, in general, be
unaffected by multicast activity.  The only exception arises on some
types of local network, where the presence of level 1 or 2 hosts may
cause misdelivery of multicast IP datagrams to level 0 hosts.  Such
datagrams can easily be identified by the presence of a class D IP
address in their destination address field; they <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be quietly
discarded by hosts that do not support IP multicasting.  Class D
addresses in support of multicasting with IPv4 are described in section 4 of this memo,
IPv6 addresses for IP multicasting are described in <xref target="RFC4291"/> and <xref target="RFC7371"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="level-1-support-for-sending-but-not-receiving-multicast-ip-datagrams"><name>Level 1: support for sending but not receiving multicast IP datagrams.</name>

<t>Level 1 allows a host to partake of some multicast-based services,
such as resource location or status reporting, but it does not allow
a host to join any host groups.  An IP implementation may be upgraded
from level 0 to level 1 very easily and with little new code.  Only
sections 4, 5, and 6 of this memo are applicable to level 1
implementations.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="level-2-full-support-for-ip-multicasting"><name>Level 2: full support for IP multicasting.</name>

<t>Level 2 allows a host to join and leave host groups, as well as send
IP datagrams to host groups.  Most IPv6 hosts require Level 2 support
because IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (<xref target="RFC4861"/>, as used on most link types),
depends on multicast and requires that nodes join Solicited Node multicast addresses.</t>

<t>Level 2 requires implementation of the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)
for IPv4 and the equivalent Multicast Listener Discovery Protocol (MLD) for IPv6 
and extension of the IP and local network service interfaces within the host.</t>

<t>The current protocol versions for full Level 2 support of IP multicasting are
<xref target="IGMPv3"/> and <xref target="MLDv2"/> or lightweight versions of either protocol <xref target="IGMPv3lite"/>.</t>

<t>All of the following sections of this memo are applicable to level 2
implementations.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="host-groups"><name>HOST GROUP ADDRESSES</name>

<t>IPv4 Host groups are identified by class D IPv4 addresses, i.e., those with
"1110" as their high-order four bits.  Class E IPv4 addresses, i.e.,
those with "1111" as their high-order four bits, are reserved for
future addressing modes.</t>

<t>In Internet standard "dotted decimal" notation, IPv4 host group addresses
range from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255.  IPv4 host group addresses in the
"Local Network Control Block", 224.0.0.0 - 224.0.0.255 are
called Link-Local IPv4 host group addresses. IP datagrams with a Link-Local destination address
are called Link-Local multicast packets. The IPv4 Link-Local addresses 224.0.0.0 is
guaranteed not to be assigned to any group, and 224.0.0.1 is assigned
to the permanent group of all IPv4 hosts (including gateways).  This is
used to address all IP multicast hosts on the directly connected
network.  There is no multicast address (or any other IP address) for
all hosts on the total Internet. Allocation guidelines for Link-Local
addresses are specified in <xref target="RFC5771"/>.</t>

<t>The addresses of well-known, permanent groups are to be published in
"Assigned Numbers", see <xref target="RFC3232"/>, currently through the IANA
"IPv4 Multicast Address Space Registry". <xref target="RFC5771"/> and <xref target="RFC6034"/> refine
more detailed allocation and uses of different sub-blocks of 224.0.0.0/4.</t>

<t>The IPv6 all-hosts group address is FF02::1,
IPv6 Host groups are identified by IPv6 addresses as defined in <xref target="RFC4291"/> section 2.7
and updated by <xref target="RFC7346"/>, <xref target="RFC7371"/>. The addresses of other groups
are currently published via the IANA "IPv6 Multicast Address Space Registry".</t>

<t>IP addresses as specified in <xref target="SSM"/> are not used for
ASM IP multicast and are not considered IP host groups by <xref target="SSM"/>. They are instead
only the destination address part G of Source Specific Multicast (SSM)
IP multicast (S,G) channels.</t>

<t>Appendix I contains some background discussion of several issues
related to host group addresses.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="interface"><name>MODEL OF A HOST IP IMPLEMENTATION</name>

<t>The multicast extensions to a host IP implementation are specified in
terms of the layered model illustrated below in <xref target="FIG1"/>.  In this model, ICMP/ICMPv6
and (for level 2 hosts) IGMP/MLD are considered to be implemented within
the IP module, and the mapping of IP addresses to local network
addresses is considered to be the responsibility of local network
modules.  This model is for expository purposes only, and should not
be construed as constraining an actual implementation.</t>

<t>To provide level 1 multicasting, a host IP implementation <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
support the transmission of multicast IP datagrams.  To provide level
2 multicasting, a host <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also support the reception of multicast
IP datagrams.  Each of these two new services is described in a
separate section, below.  For each service, extensions are specified
for the IP service interface, the IP module, the local network
service interface, and an Ethernet local network module.  Extensions
to local network modules other than Ethernet are mentioned briefly,
but are not specified in detail.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sending"><name>SENDING MULTICAST IP DATAGRAMS</name>

<section anchor="extensions-to-the-ip-service-interface"><name>Extensions to the IP Service Interface</name>

<t>Multicast IP datagrams are sent using the same "Send IP" operation
used to send unicast IP datagrams; an upper-layer protocol module
merely specifies an IP host group address, rather than an individual
IP address, as the destination.  However, a number of extensions may
be necessary or desirable.</t>

<t>First, the service interface <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> provide a way for the upper-layer
protocol to specify the IPv4 time-to-live or IPv6 hop limit of an outgoing multicast
datagram, if such a capability does not already exist.  If the
upper-layer protocol chooses not to specify a time-to-live/hop limit, it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
default to 1 for all multicast IP datagrams, so that an explicit
choice is required to multicast beyond a single network.</t>

<t>Second, for hosts that may be attached to more than one network, the
service interface <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> provide a way for the upper-layer protocol
to identify which network interface is be used for the multicast
transmission.  Only one interface is used for the initial
transmission; multicast routers are responsible for forwarding to any
other networks, if necessary.  If the upper-layer protocol chooses
not to identify an outgoing interface, a default interface <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be
used, preferably under the control of system management.</t>

<t>Third (level 2 implementations only), for the case in which the host
is itself a member of a group to which a datagram is being sent, the
service interface <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> provide a way for the upper-layer protocol
to inhibit local delivery of the datagram; by default, a copy of the
datagram is looped back.  This is a performance optimization for
upper-layer protocols that restrict the membership of a group to one
process per host (such as a routing protocol), or that handle
loopback of group communication at a higher layer (such as a
multicast transport protocol).</t>

<t>IPv6 socket extensions supporting these functions are defined in <xref target="RFC3493"/>, section 5.2.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="send-extensions"><name>Extensions to the IP Module</name>

<t>To support the sending of multicast IP datagrams, the IP module <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
be extended to recognize IP host group addresses when routing
outgoing datagrams.  Most IP implementations include the following
logic:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
    if IP-destination is on the same local network,
       send datagram locally to IP-destination
    else
       send datagram locally to GatewayTo( IP-destination )
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>To allow multicast transmissions, the routing logic <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be changed to:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
    if IP-destination is on the same local network
    or IP-destination is a host group,
       send datagram locally to IP-destination
    else
       send datagram locally to GatewayTo( IP-destination )
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>If the sending host is itself a member of the destination group on
the outgoing interface, a copy of the outgoing datagram <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
looped-back for local delivery, unless inhibited by the sender.
(Level 2 implementations only.)</t>

<t>The IP source address of the outgoing datagram <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be one of the
individual addresses corresponding to the outgoing interface.</t>

<t>A host group address or IP address from an SSM range <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> never be placed
in the source address field or anywhere in a source route or record route option of an outgoing
IP datagram. These packets are not IP multicast packets but simply
invalid packets.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="extensions-to-the-local-network-service-interface"><name>Extensions to the Local Network Service Interface</name>

<t>No change to the local network service interface is required to
support the sending of multicast IP datagrams.  The IP module merely
specifies an IP host group destination, rather than an individual IP
destination, when it invokes the existing "Send Local" operation.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="ethernet"><name>Extensions to an Ethernet Local Network Module</name>

<t>The Ethernet directly supports the sending of local multicast packets
by allowing multicast addresses in the destination field of Ethernet
packets.  All that is needed to support the sending of multicast IP
datagrams is a procedure for mapping IP host group addresses to
Ethernet multicast addresses.</t>

<t>An IPv4 host group address is mapped to an Ethernet multicast address
by placing the low-order 23-bits of the IPv4 address into the low-order
23 bits of the Ethernet multicast address 01-00-5E-00-00-00 (hex).
Because there are 28 significant bits in an IPv4 host group address,
more than one host group address may map to the same Ethernet
multicast address.</t>

<t>Mapping of IPv6 host group addresses to Ethernet is defined in
<xref target="RFC2464"/> and <xref target="RFC6085"/>.</t>

<t>The address mappings for IP addresses do apply not only to
IP host group addresses, but also to destination IP addresses used
for SSM.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="extensions-to-local-network-modules-other-than-ethernet"><name>Extensions to Local Network Modules other than Ethernet</name>

<t>Other networks that directly support multicasting, such as rings or
buses conforming to the IEEE 802.2 standard, may be handled the same
way as Ethernet for the purpose of sending multicast IP datagrams.
For a network that supports broadcast but not multicast, such as the
Experimental Ethernet, all IP host group addresses may be mapped to a
single local broadcast address (at the cost of increased overhead on
all local hosts).  For a point-to-point link joining two hosts (or a
host and a multicast router), multicasts <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be transmitted
exactly like unicasts.  For a store-and-forward network like the
ARPANET or a public X.25 network, all IP host group addresses might
be mapped to the well-known local address of an IP multicast router;
a router on such a network would take responsibility for completing
multicast delivery within the network as well as among networks.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="receiving-multicast-ip-datagrams"><name>RECEIVING MULTICAST IP DATAGRAMS</name>

<section anchor="extensions-to-the-ip-service-interface-1"><name>Extensions to the IP Service Interface</name>

<t>Incoming multicast IP datagrams are received by upper-layer protocol
modules using the same "Receive IP" operation as normal, unicast
datagrams.  Selection of a destination upper-layer protocol is based
on the protocol field in the IP header, regardless of the destination
IP address.  However, before any datagrams destined to a particular
group can be received, an upper-layer protocol must ask the IP module
to join that group.  Thus, the IP service interface <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be extended
to provide two new operations:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
    JoinHostGroup  ( group-address, interface )
    
    LeaveHostGroup ( group-address, interface )
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The JoinHostGroup operation requests that this host become a member
of the host group identified by "group-address" on the given network
interface.  The LeaveGroup operation requests that this host give up
its membership in the host group identified by "group-address" on the
given network interface.  The interface argument may be omitted on
hosts that support only one interface.  For hosts that may be
attached to more than one network, the upper-layer protocol may
choose to leave the interface unspecified, in which case the request
will apply to the default interface for sending multicast datagrams
(see section 6.1).</t>

<t>It is permissible to join the same group on more than one interface,
in which case duplicate multicast datagrams may be received.  It is
also permissible for more than one upper-layer protocol to request
membership in the same group.</t>

<t>Both operations <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> return immediately (i.e., they are non-
blocking operations), indicating success or failure.  Either
operation may fail due to an invalid group address or interface
identifier.  JoinHostGroup may fail due to lack of local resources.
LeaveHostGroup may fail because the host does not belong to the given
group on the given interface.  LeaveHostGroup may succeed, but the
membership persist, if more than one upper-layer protocol has
requested membership in the same group.</t>

<t>IPv6 socket extensions supporting these functions are defined in
<xref target="RFC3493"/>, section 5.2.  <xref target="RFC3678"/> specifies socket options for
these functions for ASM and also includes socket options in support of SSM.
Note that these are UDP socket extensions but not IP socket extensions due to
the absence of widely adopted/required IP level socket APIs.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="rcv-extensions"><name>Extensions to the IP Module</name>

<t>To support the reception of multicast IP datagrams, the IP module
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be extended to maintain a list of host group memberships
associated with each network interface.  An incoming datagram
destined to one of those groups is processed exactly the same way as
datagrams destined to one of the host's individual addresses.</t>

<t>Incoming datagrams destined to groups to which the host does not
belong are discarded without generating any error report or log
entry.  On hosts with more than one network interface, if a datagram
arrives via one interface, destined for a group to which the host
belongs only on a different interface, the datagram <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be quietly
discarded.  (These cases should occur only as a result of inadequate
multicast address filtering in a local network module.)</t>

<t>An incoming datagram is not rejected for having an IPv4 time-to-live of
1 or IPv6 Hop Limit of 1. This field  <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> not automatically be decremented on
arriving datagrams that are not being forwarded.  An incoming
datagram with an IP host group address in its source address field is
quietly discarded.  An ICMP/ICMPv6 error message (Destination Unreachable,
Time Exceeded, Parameter Problem, Source Quench, or Redirect) is
never generated in response to a datagram destined to an IP host
group or SSM range destination IP address.</t>

<t>The list of host group memberships is updated in response to
JoinHostGroup and LeaveHostGroup requests from upper-layer protocols.
Each membership should have an associated reference count or similar
mechanism to handle multiple requests to join and leave the same
group.  On the first request to join and the last request to leave a
group on a given interface, the local network module for that
interface is notified, so that it may update its multicast reception
filter (see section 7.3).</t>

<t>When supporting Level 2, the IP module <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also be extended to implement the 
IGMP protocol for IPv4 and the MLD protocol for IPv6 depending on the version(s)
of IP to be supported.  IGMP/MLD are used to keep neighboring multicast
routers informed of the host group memberships present on a
particular local network. See <xref target="special"/> for potentially special treatment of
the all-hosts groups in IGMP/MLD.</t>

<t>Hosts and gateways <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> omit the sending of IGMP messages to report membership
for Link-Local IPv4 host group addresses, especially on networks known not to (be
able to) use any form of IGMP snooping. This does also apply for the IPv6 Link-Local
 host group all-hosts FF02::1, but not to other Link-Local IPv6 host groups. See <xref target="ll-apdx"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="extensions-to-the-local-network-service-interface-1"><name>Extensions to the Local Network Service Interface</name>

<t>Incoming local network multicast packets are delivered to the IP
module using the same "Receive Local" operation as local network
unicast packets.  To allow the IP module to tell the local network
module which multicast packets to accept, the local network service
interface is extended to provide two new operations:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
    JoinLocalGroup  ( group-address )
    
    LeaveLocalGroup ( group-address )
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>where "group-address" is an IP host group address.  The
JoinLocalGroup operation requests the local network module to accept
and deliver up subsequently arriving packets destined to the given IP
host group address.  The LeaveLocalGroup operation requests the local
network module to stop delivering up packets destined to the given IP
host group address.  The local network module is expected to map the
IP host group addresses to local network addresses as required to
update its multicast reception filter.  Any local network module is
free to ignore LeaveLocalGroup requests, and may deliver up packets
destined to more addresses than just those specified in
JoinLocalGroup requests, if it is unable to filter incoming packets
adequately.</t>

<t>The local network module <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> deliver up any multicast packets
that were transmitted from that module; loopback of multicasts is
handled at the IP layer or higher.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="extensions-to-an-ethernet-local-network-module"><name>Extensions to an Ethernet Local Network Module</name>

<t>To support the reception of multicast IP datagrams, an Ethernet
module <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be able to receive packets addressed to the Ethernet
multicast addresses that correspond to the host's IP host group
addresses.  It is highly desirable to take advantage of any address
filtering capabilities that the Ethernet hardware interface may have,
so that the host receives only those packets that are destined to it.</t>

<t>Unfortunately, many current Ethernet interfaces have a small limit on
the number of addresses that the hardware can be configured to
recognize.  Nevertheless, an implementation <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be capable of
listening on an arbitrary number of Ethernet multicast addresses,
which may mean "opening up" the address filter to accept all
multicast packets during those periods when the number of addresses
exceeds the limit of the filter.</t>

<t>For interfaces with inadequate hardware address filtering, it may be
desirable (for performance reasons) to perform Ethernet address
filtering within the software of the Ethernet module.  This is not
mandatory, however, because the IP module performs its own filtering
based on IP destination addresses.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="extensions-to-local-network-modules-other-than-ethernet-1"><name>Extensions to Local Network Modules other than Ethernet</name>

<t>Other multicast networks, such as IEEE 802.2 networks, can be handled
the same way as Ethernet for the purpose of receiving multicast IP
datagrams.  For pure broadcast networks, such as the Experimental
Ethernet, all incoming broadcast packets can be accepted and passed
to the IP module for IP-level filtering.  On point-to-point or
store-and-forward networks, multicast IP datagrams will arrive as
local network unicasts, so no change to the local network module
should be necessary.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="lncb"><name>ROUTING MULTICAST IP DATAGRAMS</name>

<t>IPv4 datagrams with a Link-Local destination address <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> never be forwarded to
a different link by multicast routers, regardless of their time-to-live. See <xref target="lncb-exp"/>
for explanations.</t>

<t>The equivalent requirement are specified for IPv6 in <xref target="RFC4291"/>, section 2.5.6.</t>

<t>Rules for forwarding of non Link-Local IP multicast packets are outside the

<section anchor="normative"><name>Status changes</name>

<section anchor="moving-rfc1112-and-igmpv1-to-historic-status"><name>Moving RFC1112 and IGMPv1 to historic status</name>

<t>This document moves <xref target="RFC1112"/> to historic status which also moves the IGMP version
1 protocol as specified in Appendix 1 of <xref target="RFC1112"/> to historic status, as
it is not included into this document anymore.</t>

<t>All other aspects of <xref target="RFC1112"/> beside IGMPv1 are kept and updated by this document
and maintain their current Internet Standard designation from <xref target="RFC1112"/> through the
normative status of this document.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="backward-compatibility-with-igmpv1"><name>Backward compatibility with IGMPv1</name>

<t>Current or future versions of IGMP or other protocols/mechanisms including but not
necessary limited to <xref target="IGMPv2"/>, <xref target="IGMPv3"/> or <xref target="IGMPv3lite"/> do or may include backward 
compatibility with IGMPv1, such as in <xref target="IGMPsnooping"/>, which requires them to refer
to the <xref target="RFC1112"/> specification of IGMPv1.</t>

<t>This document does not ask for any change to any specifications or implementations that
includes any form of support for IGMPv1 for backward compatibility reasons as long as it
also includes compatibility with a newer version of IGMP starting with <xref target="IGMPv2"/>.</t>

<t>Any new or updated specification that wants to maintain such backward compatibility with
IGMPv1 need to continue to reference <xref target="RFC1112"/> as the specification of IGMPv1.</t>

<t>Any future reference for new or updated work to any other definition from <xref target="RFC1112"/>
(host extensions for IP multicast and/or Any Source Multicast service) need to refer to this document instead of <xref target="RFC1112"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="update"><name>Update to RFC 791</name>

<t>This document is an update to <xref target="RFC791"/> because none of the core procedures to send
and receive IP multicast packets described in this document match those defined for
IP unicast packets in <xref target="RFC791"/>. Instead, IP multicast is carving out parts of the IP address space
to trigger completely new forwarding for completely new entities: host groups in ASM, channels in SSM).
See <xref target="rfc791"/> for further discussions.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="update-to-std-5"><name>Update to STD 5</name>

<t>This document replaces <xref target="RFC1112"/> in <xref target="STD5"/> which defines IPv4 (<xref target="RFC791"/>) including its core extensions.</t>

<t>Note: As there is no precedent for STD86 (IPv6) to include any specifications for extension of IPv6,
this document is not asked to become part of STD86.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="changes"><name>Changes from RFC1112</name>

<t>Beyond the status changes described in <xref target="normative"/>, this document introduces
the following changes over <xref target="RFC1112"/>.</t>

<t>All requirements changes are intended to make
this specification aligned with long-term, most widely implemented, deployed and
standardised RFCs for IP multicast, so that this document does not create the need to
change existing implementations or deployments, as could be the case if <xref target="RFC1112"/> (without IGMPv1)
was to be implemented today.</t>

<section anchor="normative-language"><name>Normative language</name>

<t>This document introduces the use of normative language through capitalization. <xref target="RFC1112"/>
preceded <xref target="RFC2119"/> and hence did not include this language.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="references-to-igmpv1"><name>References to IGMPv1</name>

<t>References to IGMPv1 in <xref target="RFC1112"/> are replaced with references to <xref target="IGMPv3"/> in this text.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="new-summary"><name>New summary</name>

<t>The new <xref target="summary"/> summarizes the scope of this document and the core new
changes over <xref target="RFC1112"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="any-source-multicast-asm"><name>Any-Source Multicast (ASM)</name>

<t>This update introduces the term "ASM IP multicast" (ASM) as a new term for
the IP service interface specified in this document (and previously
in <xref target="RFC1112"/>) as explained in <xref target="summary"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="ssm"><name>SSM</name>

<t><xref target="summary"/> explains the relationship of this document to SSM (<xref target="SSM"/>).</t>

<t><xref target="host-groups"/> adds the specification that the term host groups specified in this
document does not apply to destination addresses used for SSM.</t>

<t>No functional changes to the IP multicast service are incurred by these changes,
except that it acknowledges the existence of SSM which reduces the range
of host group addresses used for ASM.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="applicability-to-both-ipv4-and-ipv6"><name>Applicability to both IPv4 and IPv6</name>

<t>This document is written to apply to both IPv4 and IPv6 by adding 
detail for IPv6 where <xref target="RFC1112"/> only covered IPv4. This includes addressing and protocols
in support of the service - Multicast Listener Discovery <xref target="MLDv2"/> for IPv6 versus
IGMP for IPv4.</t>

<t>IPv6 documents such as <xref target="RFC1883"/> and all its updates (e.g.: <xref target="RFC8200"/>) are defining
the necessary wire encoding aspects of IP multicast in the assumption of the service of
<xref target="RFC1112"/> for IPv6, but without being able to refer to <xref target="RFC1112"/>, as it was only defined
for IPv4. Future documents can refer to this document as the IP multicast / ASM service for
both IPv4 and IPv6.</t>

<t>Additional text provides references for IETF UDP socket API specifications that instantiate
the abstract APIs defined in this document.</t>

<t>No functional changes to the IP multicast service are incurred by these changes.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="lncb-exp"><name>IPv4 Local Network Control Block</name>

<t><xref target="RFC1112"/> defines the requirement for IPv4 datagrams to the all-hosts group
224.0.0.1 to never be forwarded beyond a single network.  In later RFCs, this behavior
became the BCP for the whole IPv4 Local Network Control Block 224.0.0.0 - 224.0.0.255,
making it the Link-Local host group address block for IPv4 multicast. <xref target="RFC2365"/>
and <xref target="RFC5771"/>, section 4 are the BCPs covering this requirement.</t>

<t>This document formalizes this BCP behavior as a standard requirement in <xref target="lncb"/>, superseding
and encompassing the more specific requirement for just 224.0.0.1 from <xref target="RFC1112"/>,
and mirroring the same standardized behavior for IPv6 Link-Local addresses. Because
this is actually a requirement against IP multicast routers and not hosts, this is now also
accordingly described in a separate section.</t>

<t>This requirement does not incur changes over how IP multicast is implemented or deployed.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="special"><name>Special treatment of 224.0.0.1 and FF02::1</name>

<t><xref target="RFC1112"/>, section 7.2 introduced the requirements for hosts to permanently
join 224.0.0.1. Its explains this requirement to be in support of IGMP (version 1).</t>

<t>Likewise, <xref target="IGMPv2"/>, section 6. and <xref target="IGMPv3"/>, section 5. repeat this requirement,
and <xref target="MLDv1"/>, section 6. and <xref target="MLDv2"/> section 6. also define the same requirement
for the IPv6 all-hosts address FF02::1.</t>

<t>Because this requirement is considered part of IGMP/MLD, and because this document
does not anymore specify any form of IGMP, it does not repeat this requirement from <xref target="RFC1112"/>.
Instead, this requirement now solely relies on IGMP/MLD specifications to define it.</t>

<t>These text changes do therefore not incur any requirements changes for implementations
of these existing versions of IGMP/MLD, By leaving out this requirement from the document,
future versions of IGMP/MLD are also free to choose whether to carry on this method
without having to update this document.</t>

<t>Note that <xref target="IGMPv3lite"/> omits this requirement.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="igmpmld-messages-for-link-local-ipv4-host-group-addresses"><name>IGMP/MLD messages for Link-Local IPv4 host group addresses</name>

<t><xref target="RFC1112"/>, Appendix I. (IGMPv1), <xref target="IGMPv2"/>, <xref target="IGMPv3"/>, <xref target="MLDv1"/>, <xref target="MLDv2"/>
require hosts to not send IGMP/MLD messages for the all-hosts group. This would
be in conflict of the general rules of <xref target="RFC1112"/> (outside of its IGMPv1 specific
definitions) and equally this specification if it was not enhanced. This specification
therefore contains new text that makes it compatible with existing IGMP/MLD specification,
and with long tern established and deployed implementation practices.</t>

<t>New text in <xref target="ll-apdx"/> explains how after <xref target="RFC1112"/>, it became a common place
implementation choice to not send IGMP messages for any IPv4 Link-Local host group
address, and explains how this was done with good technical reason at the time. This
behavior is so common, that <xref target="IGMPsnooping"/> mandates to explicit support it IGMP
snooping implementations.</t>

<t>Referring to that explanation, a new <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> requirement in <xref target="rcv-extensions"/> allowing
(but not recommending) this behavior makes existing specifications and deployments
compatible with this documents specifications. It is only a <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> even though it is common in
IPv4, because the experience with IPv6 shows that it does work (of course) equally
well if this is not done, and can then support better MLD snooping than IGMP snooping.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="standard-for-ip-multicasting-in-controlled-networks"><name>Standard for IP multicasting in controlled networks</name>

<t>This document removes the claim in the abstract of <xref target="RFC1112"/>, that these host extensions are
"... the recommended standard for IP multicasting in the Internet."</t>

<t>The reason for this is that <xref target="RFC8815"/> deprecated the ASM service
across the Internet because there is no Internet Standard solution
for protocols to support interdomain ASM except for <xref target="RFC3956"/>, which
is only applicable to IPv6, and even that solution does not resolve
the challenges to source access control in interdomain deployments.</t>

<t>In result, ASM is today "only" a recommended solution for controlled networks
including controlled federated networks for applications for which SSM is
not preferable.</t>

<t>However, these limitations to the applicability of ASM do not impact the applicability
of any parts of the host stack described in this document for other IP multicast service
interfaces, specifically "Source Specific Multicast", <xref target="SSM"/>, which inherits all aspects of
ASM specified in this document, especially the sending (<xref target="sending"/>, <xref target="send-extensions"/>)
of IP multicast packets as well as the mapping to ethernet (<xref target="ethernet"/>). It only amends the
joining of IP multicast traffic on IP multicast receivers with additional procedures fitting
into the host stack described in this document.</t>

<t>IANA is asked to replace the Reference field for the IGMP protocol in the Protocol Numbers registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml) from <xref target="RFC1112"/> to [THIS-RFC].</t>

<t>Explanation: This protocol number is used by all versions of IGMP, including <xref target="IGMPv2"/> and <xref target="IGMPv3"/> and is unaffected by making IGMP version 1 historic.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="internet-group-management-protocol-igmp-type-numbers-registry"><name>Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) Type Numbers Registry</name>

<t>Explanation: This type code messages where introduced by <xref target="RFC1112"/> but modified versions thereof where also introduced by [RFC2236] and [RFC3376], so that it is clearer if all three RFCs are indicated. All other references to <xref target="RFC1112"/> in this registry are specifically referring to that RFC in it's role of defining IGMP version 1 and thus need to continue to refer to <xref target="RFC1112"/> and not [THIS-RFC.</t>

      <abstract>
	 <t>   IGMP is the protocol used by IPv4 systems to report their IP
   multicast group memberships to neighboring multicast routers.
   Version 3 of IGMP adds support for source filtering, that is, the
   ability for a system to report interest in receiving packets only
   from specific source addresses, or from all but specific source
   addresses, sent to a particular multicast address.  That information
   may be used by multicast routing protocols to avoid delivering
   multicast packets from specific sources to networks where there are
   no interested receivers.

   This document specifies Version 3 of the Internet Group Management
   Protocol, IGMPv3.  It is a revised version of the specification to

      <abstract>
	 <t>   This document updates RFC 2710, and it specifies Version 2 of the
   Multicast Listener Discovery Protocol (MLDv2).  MLD is used by an
   IPv6 router to discover the presence of multicast listeners on
   directly attached links, and to discover which multicast addresses
   are of interest to those neighboring nodes.  MLDv2 is designed to be
   interoperable with MLDv1.  MLDv2 adds the ability for a node to
   report interest in listening to packets with a particular multicast
   address only from specific source addresses or from all sources
   except for specific source addresses.

   This document obsoletes RFC 3810.

      <t>This memo specifies the Versatile Message Transaction Protocol (VMTP) [Version 0.7 of 19-Feb-88], a transport protocol specifically designed to support the transaction model of communication, as exemplified by remote procedure call (RPC). The full function of VMTP, including support for security, real-time, asynchronous message exchanges, streaming, multicast and idempotency, provides a rich selection to the VMTP user level. Subsettability allows the VMTP module for particular clients and servers to be specialized and simplified to the services actually required. Examples of such simple clients and servers include PROM network bootload programs, network boot servers, data sensors and simple controllers, to mention but a few examples.

      <t>The de facto standard Application Program Interface (API) for TCP/IP applications is the "sockets" interface. Although this API was developed for Unix in the early 1980s it has also been implemented on a wide variety of non-Unix systems. TCP/IP applications written using the sockets API have in the past enjoyed a high degree of portability and we would like the same portability with IPv6 applications. But changes are required to the sockets API to support IPv6 and this memo describes these changes. These include a new socket address structure to carry IPv6 addresses, new address conversion functions, and some new socket options. These extensions are designed to provide access to the basic IPv6 features required by TCP and UDP applications, including multicasting, while introducing a minimum of change into the system and providing complete compatibility for existing IPv4 applications. Additional extensions for advanced IPv6 features (raw sockets and access to the IPv6 extension headers) are defined in another document. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>

<section anchor="host-group-address-issues"><name>HOST GROUP ADDRESS ISSUES</name>

<t>This appendix is not part of the IP multicasting specification, but
provides background discussion of several issues related to IP host
group addresses.</t>

<section anchor="group-address-binding"><name>Group Address Binding</name>

<t>The binding of IP host group addresses to physical hosts may be
considered a generalization of the binding of IP unicast addresses.
An IP unicast address is statically bound to a single local network
interface on a single IP network.  An IP host group address is
dynamically bound to a set of local network interfaces on a set of IP
networks.</t>

<t>It is important to understand that an IP host group address is NOT
bound to a set of IP unicast addresses.  The multicast routers do not
need to maintain a list of individual members of each host group.
For example, a multicast router attached to an Ethernet need
associate only a single Ethernet multicast address with each host
group having local members, rather than a list of the members'
individual IP or Ethernet addresses.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="allocation-of-transient-host-group-addresses"><name>Allocation of Transient Host Group Addresses</name>

<t>This memo does not specify how transient group address are allocated.
It is anticipated that different portions of the IP transient host
group address space will be allocated using different techniques.
For example, there may be a number of servers that can be contacted
to acquire a new transient group address.  Some higher-level
protocols (such as VMTP, specified in <xref target="RFC1045"/>) may generate higher-
level transient "process group" or "entity group" addresses which are
then algorithmically mapped to a subset of the IP transient host
group addresses, similarly to the way that IP host group addresses
are mapped to Ethernet multicast addresses.  A portion of the IP
group address space may be set aside for random allocation by
applications that can tolerate occasional collisions with other
multicast users, perhaps generating new addresses until a suitably
"quiet" one is found.</t>

<t>In general, a host cannot assume that datagrams sent to any host
group address will reach only the intended hosts, or that datagrams
received as a member of a transient host group are intended for the
recipient.  Misdelivery must be detected at a level above IP, using
higher-level identifiers or authentication tokens.  Information
transmitted to a host group address should be encrypted or governed
by administrative routing controls if the sender is concerned about
unwanted listeners.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="ll-apdx"><name>Link-local IP multicast and IGMP/MLD</name>

<t>On networks, where IP multicast packets are broadcast, such as (non-switched)
ethernet, IP multicast packets will reach all level 2 IP multicast receivers
without the need to use IGMP or MLD. This signaling is only necessary for IP multicast 
receivers when the sender is in a different LAN so that IP multicast routers
can forward the IP multicast traffic from the sender network to the receiver
network.</t>

<t>IP multicast packet to a Link-Local IP multicast destination address do therefore
technically never need any IGMP or MLD signaling on such (non-switched broadcast) networks,
because they are never forwarded between networks (<xref target="lncb"/>).</t>

<t>During the early years of IPv4 multicast, this understanding resulted in implementations
for protocols that receive Link-Local IPv4 multicast packet without implementing
IGMP. Examples of such protocols include RIPv2 (<xref target="RFC1723"/>) or OSPF (<xref target="RFC2328"/>) and
several other protocols, often running on IPv4 routers which had no IPv4 multicast routing
implementation at the time and no IPv4 multicast applications for which they
needed to be IPv4 multicast receiver for non Link-Local IPv4 multicast addresses.</t>

<t>When these implementations later received implementations of level 2
IPv4 multicast support, those implementations excluded Link-Local host
groups, so that those protocols would continue to run without IGMP as
they had in before.</t>

<t>Contributing to these implementation choices was also the fact that IGMP
in the versions specified so far does not allow to keep track of ongoing receiver
membership status in the absence of an IGMP router side implementation, called
an IGMP querier. With the target (Link-Local IPv4 multicast only) protocols being 
deployed in the absence of any such IGMP querier, the use of IGMP could also serve
arguably no purpose except for compliance with <xref target="RFC1112"/>.</t>

<t>This situation changed towards the end of the 1990th with the introduction
of ethernet switches that snoop IGMP messages to constrain forwarding of IPv4 multicast
packets for a particular IPv4 multicast group to only those ports with hosts joined
to the group.  This behavior was later documented in <xref target="IGMPsnooping"/> but was widely deployed
even earlier due to the co-existence of ports with the different speeds
10Mbps, 100Mbps and 1Gbps, and the resulting need to protect the slower
speed ports from potentially large rates of IPv4 multicast traffic between faster hosts.</t>

<t>In result, IGMP snooping switches had to flood traffic to Link-Local IPv4 multicast
groups due to the common absence of IGMP support for them, and this is accordingly
also recommended by <xref target="IGMPsnooping"/>.</t>

<t>Due to this long-term practice, this document is thus permitting this non-use of
IGMP for Link-Local host groups by introducing a <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> for it in <xref target="rcv-extensions"/>.</t>

<t>Note that IP multicast routers do not and can not typically report IP multicast
groups via IGMP or MLD, because they are not joined to them as an IP multicast host,
but simply need to receive them as an IP multicast router to forward them. Even when
an IP multicast router is joined to specific IP multicast group as an IP multicast
host, reporting them via IGMP may sound futile because as an IP multicast router it
would still need to receive the IP multicast traffic in the absence of such IGMP reporting,
because it might need to forward it. However, this logic does not apply to Link-Local groups,
because they are never forwarded and could thus be filtered by IGMP or MLD snooping switches
if those switches could trust routers to report them correctly. Which they can not do
for IPv4 due to its history.</t>

<t>In recognition of this situation, <xref target="MLDv1"/> for IPv6 did emphasize the need to
report also Link-Local IPv6 group memberships to avoid these issues. Therefore this
document also has no equivalent <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> statement for IPv6.</t>

<t>Note that IGMP/MLD reporting for non Link-Local IP multicast groups from an
IP multicast router joining it as a host is also not just a superficial specification
requirement because of the assumption that routers need to receive all non Link-Local IP multicast packets.</t>

<t>Switches that do support snooping of IP multicast routing protocols such as PIM
may also be able to determine which traffic needs to be forwarded to an
IP multicast router but those can may not include the groups that the
IP multicast router has only joined to only as a host and is not reporting via IGMP/MLD.</t>

<section anchor="discussion-and-explanations-to-be-removed"><name>Discussion and Explanations (TO BE REMOVED)</name>

<t>[RFC-editor: Please remove this Appendix after observing the following section addressed to you]</t>

<t>Please refer to <xref target="changes"/> for the non-process discussion of the goals of this document.</t>

<section anchor="rfc-editor-notes"><name>RFC-Editor notes</name>

<t>The kramdown tooling did not allow to have references for both STD5 and RFC1112,
those fail because the STD5 reference creates an "RFC1112" anchor. Thus there
is no separate reference for RFC1112 in this version of the document. This
needs to be fixed in XML by adding a full reference to RFC1112 and removing the
RFC1112 anchor from the STD5 reference.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="goals-and-evolution-of-this-document"><name>Goals and evolution of this document</name>

<t>The initial goal of this document was to allow for IETF to declare the IGMPv1
protocol historic which today is a Full Internet Standard due to it being defined
in RFC1112. This should be achieved without changing the Full Internet Standard status
of the IP Host Extensions for IP Multicast and ASM IP Service interface specified in
RFC1112 because those specification are as fundamental to the definition of IP
multicast as RFC791 is for IP (unicast).</t>

<t>The best way to achieve this seemed to be an update to RFC1112 which
removes all of IGMPv1, but maintains the rest of the document. None of these
removal of IGMPv1 changes changed the applicability or requirements to existing 
IP multicast (plus its protocols) implementations or other specifications.</t>

<t>The next refinement was to rectify the situation that there is no specification
explaining the same details as RFC1112 for IPv6 multicast even though RFC8200
(full internet standard) even explicitly includes IPv6 multicast, and a range of
other RFC define necessary code-points (such as for ethernet mapping) for IPv6 multicast.</t>

<t>Most of the text of this specification can hence can simply talk about "IP" which in this
specification implies both IPv4 and IPv6, and only in places where IPv6 differs, does the
document now include new explicit text, most often pointing to pre-existing RFCs specifying
the necessary details for IPv6. Again, none of these changes impact other specs or
deployments.</t>

<t>The third step of refinement was add the necessary verbiage to explain
the differences between SSM and the specifications in this document. None of
these text enhancements incur any functional changes of long-term established
practices. Instead, they are only resulting in references to SSM RFCs, introduction
of the term ASM (which was previously only defined in SSM RFCs), and the limitation
of applicability of terms in this document (such as host group) to their use with
ASM.</t>

<t>The last round of changes added and refined details to be in-line with long-term established
practices and removing any possible contradictions between the original RFC1112 text
and newer standards track specification such as IGMPv2/MLDv3 or long term established
implementation practices. This includes the limitation of scope of ASM to controlled
networks and the definition of the IPv4 Link-Local
address range, which so far had only been defined through BCP RFC, unlike in IPv6, where
it's part of the architecture, as well as permitting (but not recommending) non-use of IGMP for them.</t>

<t>In summary, all changes in the document will make this document a replacement of rfc1112
which much more reflects the full internet standard nature of the technology than
rfc1112 did as of recent.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="rfc791"><name>Update to RFC791</name>

<t>This version of the text proposes that this spec is declared to be an
update to RFC791.</t>

<t>The argument made in <xref target="update"/> to support this classification 
may not be persuasive enough (because the according rfc791 text
may be read as a perfectly good extension point specification), in which
case the update status and related text should be deleted.</t>

<t>However, If anyone where to come up with a re-use of 224.0.0.0/4 for any non-IP
multicast purposes,  havoc might ensure with devices that do assume IP multicast
semantics, so it may simply be prudent to include this declaration. It would
also make the relationship between IPv4 and IPv4 multicast be more aligned
with IPv6, where IPv6 multicast is included in RFC8200.</t>

<section anchor="draft-ietf-pim-rfc1112bis-03"><name>draft-ietf-pim-rfc1112bis-03</name>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Changed document text to make the term "ASM" apply only to the IP service interface
(extensions) specified by the document (and shown and explained in existing text),
instead of the whole host extensions specified in this document (as it was written up to
up to -02). This is the only correct semantic, given how all the host exensions
specified in this document are shared by SSM, only the IP service interface is changed/amended by SSM.</t>
  <t>Subdivided section 2 (INTRODUCTION) into sections 2.1 (Summary), which contains new
text from this spec, and 2.2 (Overview), which is unchanged RFC1112 text.
Newly written section 2.1 to summarize the key content of this document. This was
so far only explained in the much later changes from rfc1112 section. Includes
IPv4/IPv6 applicability, ASM/SSM naming and maintaining most of RFC1112 text as a goal.</t>
  <t>Introduced text to define and explain link local IPv4 host group addresses
224.0.0.0 - 224.0.0.255. This was triggered by trying to fix the rfc1112 text
sections that Brian Haberman was concerned about, which did cover behavior for 224.0.0.1.</t>
</list></t>

<t>As it turns out, the behavior for 224.0.0.1 was quickly adopted by other
protocols getting 224.0.0.0/24 addresses and there has been no functional
specification to explain the non-forwarding behavior for these link-local addresses.
Instead, only IANA allocation guideline RFCs where introducing them. This is
now rectified with new explanatory text in this spec. and a new <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> requirement
to permit non-use of IGMP for those groups. See <xref target="rcv-extensions"/>.</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Changed references to IGMPv3 and MLDv2 to the -bis drafts currently in RFC-editor 
queue. Also triggered by Brian Haberman mentioning them.</t>
  <t>Improved wording in "(Normative) Status Change" section 9.</t>
</list></t>

<t>5.1 Removed "Update to rfc791" as an open issue and instead claimed it as fact
in section 9.3. Added discussion about this point to the discussion appendix
that is to be removed by RFC-editor.</t>

<t>5.1 Also added subsection to declare that this document replaces RFC1112 in STD5.</t>

  <t>Enhanced/New text in section 10., "changes from RFC1112"</t>

below, triggered by Brian's review.</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Applying changes proposed by Brian Haberman during WGLC.</t>
</list></t>

<t>7.1 Changed meaning of IP from "IPv4" to "IPv4 and IPv6", accordingly updated all text.
Makes a lot of sense given the goal of showing how most of the IP multicast host stack
operates the same for IPv4 and IPv6.</t>

<t>7.2 Re-added requirement for routers not to forward link-local multicast</t>

<t>7.3 adding <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> requirement to allow non-signaling of Link-Local scope IPv4 multicast
and IPv6 all-hosts group, and explanations how this is better than the prior
definitions from rfc1112. Also includes new (length) Appendix A.3 to justify this
for IPv4.</t>

<t>7.4 text nits (thanks, Brian).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="draft-ietf-pim-rfc1112bis-02"><name>draft-ietf-pim-rfc1112bis-02</name>

<t>Removed unused references, fefresh - waiting for more reviews.
Added IANA section for updates from RFC1112 to RFC1112bis.
Added  references to RFC5771 and RFC6034 because
they actually are the references for the IANA 224.0.0.0/4 registrations,
which seems a bit undocumented given how RFC1112 did introduce the
definition (before IANA).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="draft-ietf-pim-rfc1112bis-01"><name>draft-ietf-pim-rfc1112bis-01</name>

<t>Fix up reference for IGMPv3. Refined candidate open issues. Removed author discussion.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="draft-eckert-pim-rfc1112bis-02"><name>draft-eckert-pim-rfc1112bis-02</name>

<t>Changed core references from numbered style to name style .</t>

<t>Changed copyright clause to pre5378Trust200902, which is the same as used for RFC8200
due to the presence of text with similar early status.</t>

<t>To resolve Dino's concerns at IETF116 with -01:
Added hopefully extensive explanation wrt. to how to treat IGMPv1 based on Dino's feedback
from IETF117: This document does not ask for any removal of IGMPv1 in any IETF specs
which include it for backward compatibility reasons, it only effectively causes it to
become historic once RFC1112 would be declared historic.</t>

<t>To resolve Alvaros concerns at IETF1116 with -01:
Added normative language (<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>/<bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>). Seems as if this is quite easy given how "must" was written appropriately in the original text. The logic of applying <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>/<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>-NOT was based on understanding by the author how none of the <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> would actually put existing working implementations out of compliance.</t>

<t>Added explicit text to move rfc1112 to historic status.</t>

<t>Moved explanation of changes from rfc1112 from appendix to main text as this seem to the
common practice for document updates.</t>

<t>Added claim for this document to be an update to rfc791. See open issues section though.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="draft-eckert-pim-rfc1112bis-01"><name>draft-eckert-pim-rfc1112bis-01</name>

<t>Changed all use of IPv4 back to IP. Seems standard in IETF specs. Only IPv6 has
in IETF specs the distinction of including the version.</t>

<t>Changed Steve Deerings address to a pseudo-email address at IETF. See prior section.</t>

<t>Converted document into kramdownrfc2629 format for easier editing.</t>

<t>Claims that rfc2119 language is not desired/used (to maintain maximum original text without changes).</t>

<t>Rewrote section for updates to rfc1112 to hopefully better motivate/explain the reason for this document and detail what its changes are.</t>
