<section anchor="introduction"><name>INTRODUCTION</name>

<t>The host extensions defined in this memo are called
Any Source Multicast (ASM) IP multicast or abbreviated IP multicast. 
The term Any Source Multicast is used to distinguish these extensions
from Source Specific Multicast (SSM) IP multicast as defined by <xref target="SSM"/>.
The abbreviation IP multicast always refers to this memo's extensions.</t>

<t>This memo applies to both IP and IPv6. When it uses the term IP it
implies either or both version of the IP protocol. It uses
the terms IP and/or IPv6 explicitly when referring to functions
applicable to only a specific version of the IP protocol.</t>

<t>This document replaces <xref target="RFC1112"/> for anything but the specification of IGMP version 1
in Appendix I. of <xref target="RFC1112"/>. See <xref target="normative"/> and <xref target="changes"/> for a detailled
list of changes from that memo.</t>

<t>IP multicasting is the transmission of an IP datagram to a "host
group", a set of zero or more hosts identified by a single IP
destination address.  A multicast datagram is delivered to all
members of its destination host group with the same "best-efforts"
reliability as regular unicast IP datagrams, i.e., the datagram is
not guaranteed to arrive intact at all members of the destination
group or in the same order relative to other datagrams.</t>

<t>The membership of a host group is dynamic; that is, hosts may join
and leave groups at any time.  There is no restriction on the
location or number of members in a host group.  A host may be a
member of more than one group at a time.  A host need not be a member
of a group to send datagrams to it.</t>

<t>A host group may be permanent or transient.  A permanent group has a
well-known, administratively assigned IP address.  It is the address,
not the membership of the group, that is permanent; at any time a
permanent group may have any number of members, even zero.  Those IP
multicast addresses that are not reserved for permanent groups are
available for dynamic assignment to transient groups which exist only
as long as they have members.</t>

<t>Internetwork forwarding of IP multicast datagrams is handled by
"multicast routers" which may be co-resident with, or separate from,
internet gateways.  A host transmits an IP multicast datagram as a
local network multicast which reaches all immediately-neighboring
members of the destination host group.  If the datagram has an IP
time-to-live greater than 1, the multicast router(s) attached to the
local network take responsibility for forwarding it towards all other
networks that have members of the destination group.  On those other
member networks that are reachable within the IP time-to-live, an
attached multicast router completes delivery by transmitting the
datagram as a local multicast.</t>

<t>This memo specifies the extensions required of a host IP
implementation to support IP multicasting, where a "host" is any
internet host or gateway other than those acting as multicast
routers.  The algorithms and protocols used within and between
multicast routers are transparent to hosts and will be specified in
separate documents.  This memo also does not specify how local
network multicasting is accomplished for all types of network,
although it does specify the required service interface to an
arbitrary local network and gives an Ethernet specification as an
example.  Specifications for other types of network will be the
subject of future memos.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="levels-of-conformance"><name>LEVELS OF CONFORMANCE</name>

<t>There are three levels of conformance to this specification:</t>

<section anchor="level-0-no-support-for-ip-multicasting"><name>Level 0: no support for IP multicasting.</name>

<t>There is, at this time, no requirement that all IP implementations
support IP multicasting.  Level 0 hosts will, in general, be
unaffected by multicast activity.  The only exception arises on some
types of local network, where the presence of level 1 or 2 hosts may
cause misdelivery of multicast IP datagrams to level 0 hosts.  Such
datagrams can easily be identified by the presence of a class D IP
address in their destination address field; they <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be quietly
discarded by hosts that do not support IP multicasting.  Class D
addresses are described in section 4 of this memo.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="level-1-support-for-sending-but-not-receiving-multicast-ip-datagrams"><name>Level 1: support for sending but not receiving multicast IP datagrams.</name>

<t>Level 1 allows a host to partake of some multicast-based services,
such as resource location or status reporting, but it does not allow
a host to join any host groups.  An IP implementation may be upgraded
from level 0 to level 1 very easily and with little new code.  Only
sections 4, 5, and 6 of this memo are applicable to level 1
implementations.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="level-2-full-support-for-ip-multicasting"><name>Level 2: full support for IP multicasting.</name>

<t>Level 2 allows a host to join and leave host groups, as well as send
IP datagrams to host groups.  Most IPv6 hosts require Level 2 support
because IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (<xref target="RFC4861"/>, as used on most link types)
depends on multicast and requires that nodes join Solicited Node multicast addresses.</t>

<t>Level 2 requires implementation of the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)
for IP and the equivalent Multicast Listener Discovery Protocol (MLD) for IPv6 
and extension of the IP and local network service interfaces within the host.</t>

<t>The current protocol versions for full support of IP multicasting are <xref target="IGMPv3"/> and <xref target="MLDv2"/> or lightweight
versions of either protocol <xref target="IGMPv3LITE"/>.</t>

<t>All of the following sections of this memo are applicable to level 2
implementations.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="host-group-addresses"><name>HOST GROUP ADDRESSES</name>

<t>IP Host groups are identified by class D IP addresses, i.e., those with
"1110" as their high-order four bits.  Class E IP addresses, i.e.,
those with "1111" as their high-order four bits, are reserved for
future addressing modes.</t>

<t>In Internet standard "dotted decimal" notation, host group addresses
range from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255.  The address 224.0.0.0 is
guaranteed not to be assigned to any group, and 224.0.0.1 is assigned
to the permanent group of all IP hosts (including gateways).  This is
used to address all IP multicast hosts on the directly connected
network.  There is no multicast address (or any other IP address) for
all hosts on the total Internet.  The addresses of other well-known,
permanent groups are to be published in "Assigned Numbers".</t>

<t>IPv6 Host groups are identified by IPv6 addresses as defined in <xref target="RFC4291"/> section 2.7
and updated by <xref target="RFC7346"/>, <xref target="RFC7371"/>.</t>

<t>IP and IPv6 addresses as specified in <xref target="SSM"/> are not used for
ASM IP multicast and are not considered IP host groups. They are instead
only the destination address part G of Source Specific Multicast (SSM)
IP multicast (S,G) channels.</t>

<t>Appendix I contains some background discussion of several issues
related to host group addresses.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="model-of-a-host-ip-implementation"><name>MODEL OF A HOST IP IMPLEMENTATION</name>

<t>The multicast extensions to a host IP implementation are specified in
terms of the layered model illustrated below in <xref target="FIG1"/>.  In this model, ICMP/ICMPv6
and (for level 2 hosts) IGMP/MLD are considered to be implemented within
the IP module, and the mapping of IP addresses to local network
addresses is considered to be the responsibility of local network
modules.  This model is for expository purposes only, and should not
be construed as constraining an actual implementation.</t>

<t>To provide level 1 multicasting, a host IP implementation <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
support the transmission of multicast IP datagrams.  To provide level
2 multicasting, a host <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also support the reception of multicast
IP datagrams.  Each of these two new services is described in a
separate section, below.  For each service, extensions are specified
for the IP service interface, the IP module, the local network
service interface, and an Ethernet local network module.  Extensions
to local network modules other than Ethernet are mentioned briefly,
but are not specified in detail.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sending"><name>SENDING MULTICAST IP DATAGRAMS</name>

<section anchor="extensions-to-the-ip-service-interface"><name>Extensions to the IP Service Interface</name>

<t>Multicast IP datagrams are sent using the same "Send IP" operation
used to send unicast IP datagrams; an upper-layer protocol module
merely specifies an IP host group address, rather than an individual
IP address, as the destination.  However, a number of extensions may
be necessary or desirable.</t>

<t>First, the service interface <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> provide a way for the upper-layer
protocol to specify the IP time-to-live of an outgoing multicast
datagram, if such a capability does not already exist.  If the
upper-layer protocol chooses not to specify a time-to-live, it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
default to 1 for all multicast IP datagrams, so that an explicit
choice is required to multicast beyond a single network.</t>

<t>Second, for hosts that may be attached to more than one network, the
service interface <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> provide a way for the upper-layer protocol
to identify which network interface is be used for the multicast
transmission.  Only one interface is used for the initial
transmission; multicast routers are responsible for forwarding to any
other networks, if necessary.  If the upper-layer protocol chooses
not to identify an outgoing interface, a default interface <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be
used, preferably under the control of system management.</t>

<t>Third (level 2 implementations only), for the case in which the host
is itself a member of a group to which a datagram is being sent, the
service interface <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> provide a way for the upper-layer protocol
to inhibit local delivery of the datagram; by default, a copy of the
datagram is looped back.  This is a performance optimization for
upper-layer protocols that restrict the membership of a group to one
process per host (such as a routing protocol), or that handle
loopback of group communication at a higher layer (such as a
multicast transport protocol).</t>

<t>IPv6 socket extensions supporting these functions are defined in <xref target="RFC3493"/>, section 5.2.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="extensions"><name>Extensions to the IP Module</name>

<t>To support the sending of multicast IP datagrams, the IP module <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
be extended to recognize IP host group addresses when routing
outgoing datagrams.  Most IP implementations include the following
logic:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
    if IP-destination is on the same local network,
       send datagram locally to IP-destination
    else
       send datagram locally to GatewayTo( IP-destination )
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>To allow multicast transmissions, the routing logic <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be changed to:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
    if IP-destination is on the same local network
    or IP-destination is a host group,
       send datagram locally to IP-destination
    else
       send datagram locally to GatewayTo( IP-destination )
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>If the sending host is itself a member of the destination group on
the outgoing interface, a copy of the outgoing datagram <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
looped-back for local delivery, unless inhibited by the sender.
(Level 2 implementations only.)</t>

<t>The IP source address of the outgoing datagram <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be one of the
individual addresses corresponding to the outgoing interface.</t>

<t>A host group address <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> never be placed in the source address field
or anywhere in a source route or record route option of an outgoing
IP datagram. These packets are not IP Multicast packets but simply
invalid packets.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="extensions-to-the-local-network-service-interface"><name>Extensions to the Local Network Service Interface</name>

<t>No change to the local network service interface is required to
support the sending of multicast IP datagrams.  The IP module merely
specifies an IP host group destination, rather than an individual IP
destination, when it invokes the existing "Send Local" operation.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="ethernet"><name>Extensions to an Ethernet Local Network Module</name>

<t>The Ethernet directly supports the sending of local multicast packets
by allowing multicast addresses in the destination field of Ethernet
packets.  All that is needed to support the sending of multicast IP
datagrams is a procedure for mapping IP host group addresses to
Ethernet multicast addresses.</t>

<t>An IP host group address is mapped to an Ethernet multicast address
by placing the low-order 23-bits of the IP address into the low-order
23 bits of the Ethernet multicast address 01-00-5E-00-00-00 (hex).
Because there are 28 significant bits in an IP host group address,
more than one host group address may map to the same Ethernet
multicast address.</t>

<t>Mapping of IPv6 host group addresses to Ethernet is defined in
<xref target="RFC2464"/> and <xref target="RFC6085"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="extensions-to-local-network-modules-other-than-ethernet"><name>Extensions to Local Network Modules other than Ethernet</name>

<t>Other networks that directly support multicasting, such as rings or
buses conforming to the IEEE 802.2 standard, may be handled the same
way as Ethernet for the purpose of sending multicast IP datagrams.
For a network that supports broadcast but not multicast, such as the
Experimental Ethernet, all IP host group addresses may be mapped to a
single local broadcast address (at the cost of increased overhead on
all local hosts).  For a point-to-point link joining two hosts (or a
host and a multicast router), multicasts <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be transmitted
exactly like unicasts.  For a store-and-forward network like the
ARPANET or a public X.25 network, all IP host group addresses might
be mapped to the well-known local address of an IP multicast router;
a router on such a network would take responsibility for completing
multicast delivery within the network as well as among networks.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="receiving-multicast-ip-datagrams"><name>RECEIVING MULTICAST IP DATAGRAMS</name>

<section anchor="extensions-to-the-ip-service-interface-1"><name>Extensions to the IP Service Interface</name>

<t>Incoming multicast IP datagrams are received by upper-layer protocol
modules using the same "Receive IP" operation as normal, unicast
datagrams.  Selection of a destination upper-layer protocol is based
on the protocol field in the IP header, regardless of the destination
IP address.  However, before any datagrams destined to a particular
group can be received, an upper-layer protocol must ask the IP module
to join that group.  Thus, the IP service interface <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be extended
to provide two new operations:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
    JoinHostGroup  ( group-address, interface )
    
    LeaveHostGroup ( group-address, interface )
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The JoinHostGroup operation requests that this host become a member
of the host group identified by "group-address" on the given network
interface.  The LeaveGroup operation requests that this host give up
its membership in the host group identified by "group-address" on the
given network interface.  The interface argument may be omitted on
hosts that support only one interface.  For hosts that may be
attached to more than one network, the upper-layer protocol may
choose to leave the interface unspecified, in which case the request
will apply to the default interface for sending multicast datagrams
(see section 6.1).</t>

<t>It is permissible to join the same group on more than one interface,
in which case duplicate multicast datagrams may be received.  It is
also permissible for more than one upper-layer protocol to request
membership in the same group.</t>

<t>Both operations <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> return immediately (i.e., they are non-
blocking operations), indicating success or failure.  Either
operation may fail due to an invalid group address or interface
identifier.  JoinHostGroup may fail due to lack of local resources.
LeaveHostGroup may fail because the host does not belong to the given
group on the given interface.  LeaveHostGroup may succeed, but the
membership persist, if more than one upper-layer protocol has
requested membership in the same group.</t>

<t>IPv6 socket extensions supporting these functions are defined in <xref target="RFC3493"/>, section 5.2.
<xref target="RFC3678"/> specifies these functions for IP and IPv6 (as well as for SSM). Note that
these are UDP socket extions (and not IP/IPv6 socket extensions due to the absence of
widely available/used IP/IPv6 level socket APIs).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="extensions-to-the-ip-module"><name>Extensions to the IP Module</name>

<t>To support the reception of multicast IP datagrams, the IP module
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be extended to maintain a list of host group memberships
associated with each network interface.  An incoming datagram
destined to one of those groups is processed exactly the same way as
datagrams destined to one of the host's individual addresses.</t>

<t>Incoming datagrams destined to groups to which the host does not
belong are discarded without generating any error report or log
entry.  On hosts with more than one network interface, if a datagram
arrives via one interface, destined for a group to which the host
belongs only on a different interface, the datagram is quietly
discarded.  (These cases should occur only as a result of inadequate
multicast address filtering in a local network module.)</t>

<t>An incoming datagram is not rejected for having an IP time-to-live of
1 (i.e., the time-to-live should not automatically be decremented on
arriving datagrams that are not being forwarded).  An incoming
datagram with an IP host group address in its source address field is
quietly discarded.  An ICMP/ICMPv6 error message (Destination Unreachable,
Time Exceeded, Parameter Problem, Source Quench, or Redirect) is
never generated in response to a datagram destined to an IP host
group.</t>

<t>The list of host group memberships is updated in response to
JoinHostGroup and LeaveHostGroup requests from upper-layer protocols.
Each membership should have an associated reference count or similar
mechanism to handle multiple requests to join and leave the same
group.  On the first request to join and the last request to leave a
group on a given interface, the local network module for that
interface is notified, so that it may update its multicast reception
filter (see section 7.3).</t>

<t>The IP module <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also be extended to implement the IGMP protocol for
IP and/or the MLD protocol for IPv6 (depending on the version of IP to be
supported).  IGMP/MLD are used to keep neighboring multicast
routers informed of the host group memberships present on a
particular local network.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="extensions-to-the-local-network-service-interface-1"><name>Extensions to the Local Network Service Interface</name>

<t>Incoming local network multicast packets are delivered to the IP
module using the same "Receive Local" operation as local network
unicast packets.  To allow the IP module to tell the local network
module which multicast packets to accept, the local network service
interface is extended to provide two new operations:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
    JoinLocalGroup  ( group-address )
    
    LeaveLocalGroup ( group-address )
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>where "group-address" is an IP host group address.  The
JoinLocalGroup operation requests the local network module to accept
and deliver up subsequently arriving packets destined to the given IP
host group address.  The LeaveLocalGroup operation requests the local
network module to stop delivering up packets destined to the given IP
host group address.  The local network module is expected to map the
IP host group addresses to local network addresses as required to
update its multicast reception filter.  Any local network module is
free to ignore LeaveLocalGroup requests, and may deliver up packets
destined to more addresses than just those specified in
JoinLocalGroup requests, if it is unable to filter incoming packets
adequately.</t>

<t>The local network module <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> deliver up any multicast packets
that were transmitted from that module; loopback of multicasts is
handled at the IP layer or higher.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="extensions-to-an-ethernet-local-network-module"><name>Extensions to an Ethernet Local Network Module</name>

<t>To support the reception of multicast IP datagrams, an Ethernet
module <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be able to receive packets addressed to the Ethernet
multicast addresses that correspond to the host's IP host group
addresses.  It is highly desirable to take advantage of any address
filtering capabilities that the Ethernet hardware interface may have,
so that the host receives only those packets that are destined to it.</t>

<t>Unfortunately, many current Ethernet interfaces have a small limit on
the number of addresses that the hardware can be configured to
recognize.  Nevertheless, an implementation <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be capable of
listening on an arbitrary number of Ethernet multicast addresses,
which may mean "opening up" the address filter to accept all
multicast packets during those periods when the number of addresses
exceeds the limit of the filter.</t>

<t>For interfaces with inadequate hardware address filtering, it may be
desirable (for performance reasons) to perform Ethernet address
filtering within the software of the Ethernet module.  This is not
mandatory, however, because the IP module performs its own filtering
based on IP destination addresses.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="extensions-to-local-network-modules-other-than-ethernet-1"><name>Extensions to Local Network Modules other than Ethernet</name>

<t>Other multicast networks, such as IEEE 802.2 networks, can be handled
the same way as Ethernet for the purpose of receiving multicast IP
datagrams.  For pure broadcast networks, such as the Experimental
Ethernet, all incoming broadcast packets can be accepted and passed
to the IP module for IP-level filtering.  On point-to-point or
store-and-forward networks, multicast IP datagrams will arrive as
local network unicasts, so no change to the local network module
should be necessary.</t>

as specified in Appendix 1 of <xref target="RFC1112"/> is moved to historic status. This protocol is
not included in the text of this document anymore, which hence renders IGMPv1 historic.</t>

<t>All other aspects of <xref target="RFC1112"/> beside IGMPv1 are inherited and enhanced by this document
and maintain their current Internet Standard designation from <xref target="RFC1112"/> through the
normative status of this document.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="backward-compatibility-with-igmpv1"><name>Backward compatibility with IGMPv1</name>

<t>Newer versions of IGMP or other protocols/mechisms including but not necessary limited
to <xref target="IGMPv2"/>, <xref target="IGMPv3"/> or <xref target="IGMPv3LITE"/> do or may (such as in <xref target="IGMPsnooping"/>) 
include backward compatibility with IGMPv1, which requires the 
<xref target="RFC1112"/> specification of IGMPv1.</t>

<t>This document does not ask for any change to any specifications or implementations that
includes any form of support for IGMPv1 for backward compatibility reasons as long as it
also includes compatibility with a newer version of IGMP starting with <xref target="IGMPv2"/>. Any new
or updated specification that wants to maintain such such backward compatibility with IGMPv1
needs to continue to reference the specification of IGMPv1 via <xref target="RFC1112"/>.  Any future reference
for new or updated work to any other definition from <xref target="RFC1112"/> needs to refer to this document instead.</t>

<section anchor="changes"><name>Changes from RFC1112</name>

<t>Beyond the normative changes described in <xref target="normative"/>, this document introduces
the following changes over <xref target="RFC1112"/>.</t>

<section anchor="normative-language"><name>Normative language</name>

<t>This document introduces the use of normative language through capitalization. <xref target="RFC1112"/>
preceeded this method and hence did not include this language.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="superceeding-references-to-igmpv1"><name>Superceeding references to IGMPv1</name>

<t>References to IGMPv1 in <xref target="RFC1112"/> are replaced by references to <xref target="IGMPv3"/> in this text.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="introduction-of-the-term-any-source-multicast-asm"><name>Introduction of the term Any-Source Multicast (ASM)</name>

<t>This update introduces the term "ASM IP multicast" (ASM) as another term
for "Host Extensions for IP multicast". This term was introduced when 
<xref target="SSM"/> introduced another service model for IP Multicast called
"Source Specific Multicast" (SSM), and hence, the service described in
<xref target="RFC1112"/> and this update is more precisely called Any Source Multicast (ASM) IP multicast.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC1112"/> defines and uses the term "host group". This term is not
applicable to IP/IPv6 multicast group addresses that are not used for ASM but SSM 
according to <xref target="SSM"/>. New text in this document explains this.</t>

<t>No functional changes to the IP Multicast service are incurred by these changes.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="applicability-to-both-ip-and-ipv6"><name>Applicability to both IP and IPv6</name>

<t>This document is written to apply to both IP and IPv6 by adding equivalent
detail for IPv6 where <xref target="RFC1112"/> only covered IP: addressing and protocols
in support of the service - Multicast Listener Discovery <xref target="MLDv2"/> for IPv6 versus
IGMP for IP.</t>

<t>Note: IPv6 documents such as <xref target="RFC1883"/> and all its updates (e.g.: <xref target="RFC8200"/>) are defining
multicasting in the assumption of the service of <xref target="RFC1112"/> for IPv6, but without
being able to refer to <xref target="RFC1112"/>, as it was only defined for IP. Future documents
can refer to this document as the IP Multicast / ASM service for both IP and IPv6.</t>

<t>Additional text provides references for IETF UDP socket API specifications that instantiate
the abstract APIs defined in this document.</t>

<t>No functional changes to the IP Multicast service are incurred by these text changes.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="standard-for-ip-multicasting-in-controlled-networks"><name>Standard for IP multicasting in controlled networks</name>

<t>This document removes the claim in the abstract of <xref target="RFC1112"/>, that these host extensions are
"... the recommended standard for IP multicasting in the Internet."</t>

<t>The reason for this is that <xref target="RFC8815"/> deprecated the ASM Service
across the Internet because there is no Internet Standard solution
for protocols to support interdomain ASM except for <xref target="RFC3956"/>, which
is only applicable to IPv6, and even that solution does not resolve
the challenges to source access control in interdomain deployments.</t>

<t>In result, ASM is today "only" a recommended solution for controlled networks
including controlled federated networks for applications for which SSM is
not usable.</t>

<t>However, these limitations to the applicability of ASM to no impact the applicability
of most of the host stack described in this document for other forms of IP Multicast,
specifically "Source Specific Multicast", <xref target="SSM"/>, which inherits all aspects of
ASM specified in this document, especially the sending (<xref target="sending"/>, <xref target="extensions"/>) of IP Multicast
packets as well as the mapping to ethernet (<xref target="ethernet"/>). It only amends the joining
of IP Multicast traffic on IP Multicast receivers with additional procedures fitting into
the host stack described in this document.</t>

	 <t>   This document describes an abstract application programming
   interface, API, to the transport layer that enables the selection of
   transport protocols and network paths dynamically at runtime.  This
   API enables faster deployment of new protocols and protocol features
   without requiring changes to the applications.  The specified API
   follows the Transport Services architecture by providing
   asynchronous, atomic transmission of messages.  It is intended to
   replace the BSD sockets API as the common interface to the transport
   layer, in an environment where endpoints could select from multiple
   network paths and potential transport protocols.

      <t>This memo specifies the Versatile Message Transaction Protocol (VMTP) [Version 0.7 of 19-Feb-88], a transport protocol specifically designed to support the transaction model of communication, as exemplified by remote procedure call (RPC). The full function of VMTP, including support for security, real-time, asynchronous message exchanges, streaming, multicast and idempotency, provides a rich selection to the VMTP user level. Subsettability allows the VMTP module for particular clients and servers to be specialized and simplified to the services actually required. Examples of such simple clients and servers include PROM network bootload programs, network boot servers, data sensors and simple controllers, to mention but a few examples.

    <abstract>
      <t>The de facto standard Application Program Interface (API) for TCP/IP applications is the "sockets" interface. Although this API was developed for Unix in the early 1980s it has also been implemented on a wide variety of non-Unix systems. TCP/IP applications written using the sockets API have in the past enjoyed a high degree of portability and we would like the same portability with IPv6 applications. But changes are required to the sockets API to support IPv6 and this memo describes these changes. These include a new socket address structure to carry IPv6 addresses, new address conversion functions, and some new socket options. These extensions are designed to provide access to the basic IPv6 features required by TCP and UDP applications, including multicasting, while introducing a minimum of change into the system and providing complete compatibility for existing IPv4 applications. Additional extensions for advanced IPv6 features (raw sockets and access to the IPv6 extension headers) are defined in another document. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>

      <t>This document recommends deprecation of the use of Any-Source Multicast (ASM) for interdomain multicast. It recommends the use of Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) for interdomain multicast applications and recommends that hosts and routers in these deployments fully support SSM. The recommendations in this document do not preclude the continued use of ASM within a single organization or domain and are especially easy to adopt in existing deployments of intradomain ASM using PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM).</t>

<section anchor="host-group-address-issues"><name>HOST GROUP ADDRESS ISSUES</name>

<t>This appendix is not part of the IP multicasting specification, but
provides background discussion of several issues related to IP host
group addresses.</t>

<section anchor="group-address-binding"><name>Group Address Binding</name>

<t>The binding of IP host group addresses to physical hosts may be
considered a generalization of the binding of IP unicast addresses.
An IP unicast address is statically bound to a single local network
interface on a single IP network.  An IP host group address is
dynamically bound to a set of local network interfaces on a set of IP
networks.</t>

<t>It is important to understand that an IP host group address is NOT
bound to a set of IP unicast addresses.  The multicast routers do not
need to maintain a list of individual members of each host group.
For example, a multicast router attached to an Ethernet need
associate only a single Ethernet multicast address with each host
group having local members, rather than a list of the members'
individual IP or Ethernet addresses.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="allocation-of-transient-host-group-addresses"><name>Allocation of Transient Host Group Addresses</name>

<t>This memo does not specify how transient group address are allocated.
It is anticipated that different portions of the IP transient host
group address space will be allocated using different techniques.
For example, there may be a number of servers that can be contacted
to acquire a new transient group address.  Some higher-level
protocols (such as VMTP, specified in <xref target="RFC1045"/>) may generate higher-
level transient "process group" or "entity group" addresses which are
then algorithmically mapped to a subset of the IP transient host
group addresses, similarly to the way that IP host group addresses
are mapped to Ethernet multicast addresses.  A portion of the IP
group address space may be set aside for random allocation by
applications that can tolerate occasional collisions with other
multicast users, perhaps generating new addresses until a suitably
"quiet" one is found.</t>

<t>In general, a host cannot assume that datagrams sent to any host
group address will reach only the intended hosts, or that datagrams
received as a member of a transient host group are intended for the
recipient.  Misdelivery must be detected at a level above IP, using
higher-level identifiers or authentication tokens.  Information
transmitted to a host group address should be encrypted or governed
by administrative routing controls if the sender is concerned about
unwanted listeners.</t>

<section anchor="discussion-and-explanations-to-be-removed"><name>Discussion and Explanations (TO BE REMOVED)</name>

<t>[RFC-editor: Please remove this section]</t>

<t>Please refer to <xref target="changes"/> for the non-process disucssion of the goals of this document.</t>

<section anchor="goals-of-this-document"><name>Goals of this document</name>

<t>The goal of this document is to allow for IETF to declare <xref target="RFC1112"/> historic and
inherit the full INTERNET STANDARD status of <xref target="RFC1112"/> with this document
immediately - without going through the otherwise necessary long process.</t>

<t>The reason why <xref target="RFC1112"/> needs to be declared historic is so that the IGMP
version 1 protocol specified in it can be declared obsolete. This update removes
IGMPv1 text.</t>

<t>The reason why this document is still needed (as an Internet Standard), is
because the IP Multicast service specified in <xref target="RFC1112"/> has since its inception
been the Internet Standard for the IP Multicasting service.</t>

<t>To allow for this document to gets immediately the intended Internet Standard status,
it introduces no functional changes and it deliverately avoids also any unnecessary
textual changes. This includes the deliberade non-upgrade of the <xref target="RFC1112"/> language
to use <xref target="RFC2119"/> terminology. While the use of that language might be preferred
for new work/text, the success of IP Multicasting as defined in <xref target="RFC2119"/> seems
to indicate that the existing text was more than sufficient.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="internet-standard-status"><name>Internet Standard status</name>

<t>Note that the removal of the IGMPv1 protocol may raise the question whether the
document in its current form still contains specifications sufficient for Internet
Standard as opposed to Informational.</t>

<t>The core aspects that impacts interoperability (and hence qualifies the document
for Internet Standard) is the format of IP packets when IP Multicast service is used,
e.g.: IP Multicast addressing and binding to Multicast Ethernet MAC addresses.
There is no other RFC that introduces these specifications for IP, because there was
never another update to <xref target="RFC791"/> to do this. <xref target="SSM"/>, another standards track
document bilding on <xref target="RFC1112"/>, defining the SSM service / host stack.</t>

<t>This update also includes the necessary text for IPv6. Note that for
IPv6 the ethernet MAC address mapping of IPv6 multicast packets was later (after <xref target="RFC1112"/>)
specified in <xref target="RFC1972"/> and its updates, but scattering the aspects of IPv6 multicast
across (currently) <xref target="RFC2464"/>, {RFC4291}} and <xref target="RFC8200"/> makes it arguably more
difficult for implementers to understand the technology than this document that
coalesces all these services aspects - from ethernet bonding to application interfac.</t>

<t>Beyond those packet format/ethernet aspects, historically, the Multicast service
(API) related text in <xref target="RFC1112"/> would not have been considered to be an
Internet Standards scope definition because this classification was not extended
to (abstract) APIs, even though they do of course define an interoperability interface
between e.g.: operating system providing the API and applications using it.</t>

<t>Recently, the IETF has changed its stance on this issue though and is working on
 <xref target="I-D.ietf-taps-interface"/> with the intent for it to become Internet Standard.
With this in mind, all that text of <xref target="RFC1112"/> can also be considered appropriate
for Internet Standard.</t>

<t>This document is hosted at https://github.com/toerless/rfc1112bis. Please submit issues
with this text as issues to that github and report them on pim@ietf.org.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="candidate-open-issues"><name>Candidate Open Issues</name>

<t>The following questions are left as candidate open issues, which so far the authors think
do not deservice to be pursued, but the authors want to bring them to the awareness of
reviewers.</t>

<t>RFC1112 did not claim to be an update to rfc791 even though it does effectively update RFC791
because it exempts IP Multicast packets from RFC791 processing. And also introduces invalid packets
(source address IP Multicast which are neither unicast nor multicast). If we would want, we
can still declare this document to also be an update to rfc791.</t>

<t>Likewise the same could apply to RFC8200 which does not specify these details either.</t>

<t>This document could refer to the IGMPv3bis and MLDv2bis instead of current IGMPv3/MLDv2 RFCs.</t>

<section anchor="draft-ietf-pim-rfc1112bis-02"><name>draft-ietf-pim-rfc1112bis-02</name>

<t>Removed unused references, fefresh - waiting for more reviews.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="draft-ietf-pim-rfc1112bis-01"><name>draft-ietf-pim-rfc1112bis-01</name>

<t>Fix up reference for IGMPv3. Refined candidate open issues. Removed author discussion.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="draft-ietf-pim-rfc1112bis-00"><name>draft-ietf-pim-rfc1112bis-00</name>

<t>Just changed title, added github pointer.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="draft-eckert-pim-rfc1112bis-02"><name>draft-eckert-pim-rfc1112bis-02</name>

<t>Changed core references from numbered style to name style .</t>

<t>Changed copyright clause to pre5378Trust200902, which is the same as used for RFC8200
due to the presence of text with similar early status.</t>

<t>To resolve Dinos concerns at IETF116 with -01:
Added hopefully extensive explanation wrt. to how to treat IGMPv1 based on Dino's feedback
from IETF117: This document does not ask for any removal of IGMPv1 in any IETF specs
which include it for backward compatibility reasons, it only effectively causes it to
become historic once RFC1112 would be declared historic.</t>

<t>To resolve Alvaros concerns at IETF1116 with -01:
Added normative language (<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>/<bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>). Seems as if this is quite easy given how "must" was written appropriately in the original text. The logic of applying <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>/<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>-NOT was based on understanding by the author how none of the <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> would actually put existing working implementations out of compliance.</t>

<t>Added explicit text to move rfc1112 to historic status.</t>

<t>Moved explanation of changes from rfc1112 from appendix to main text as this seem to the
common practice for document updates.</t>

<t>Added claim for this document to be an update to rfc791. See open issues section though.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="draft-eckert-pim-rfc1112bis-01"><name>draft-eckert-pim-rfc1112bis-01</name>

<t>Changed all use of IPv4 back to IP. Seems standard in IETF specs. Only IPv6 has
in IETF specs the distinction of including the version.</t>

<t>Changed Steve Deerings address to a pseudo-email address at IETF. See prior section.</t>

<t>Converted document into kramdownrfc2629 format for easier editing.</t>

<t>Claims that rfc2119 language is not desired/used (to maintain maximum original text without changes).</t>

<t>Rewrote section for updates to rfc1112 to hopefully better motivate/explain the reason for this document and detail what its changes are.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="draft-eckert-pim-rfc1112bis-00"><name>draft-eckert-pim-rfc1112bis-00</name>

<t>Initial version based on <xref target="RFC1112"/> text version, edited.</t>
